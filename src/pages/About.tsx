            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p>
                The history of TimeZen dates back to 2020, when a jewellery
                retailer was founded. In 2023, a website was established, which
                eventually became TimeZen.co.se. Since then, the business has
                grown into the largest independent watch retailer in the SE.

            <h4>Our Promise to You</h4>
            <p>
                Wondering whether our watches are genuine, considering how good
                the prices are? No need to worry; we are official stockists for
                all of our brands. Your watch will ship out of our very own
                warehouse in Reading, and before then, it will sit with the
                official manufacturer. No middle man here! This also means every
                watch you purchase with us will come in the original brand
                packaging and with a valid guarantee. Plus any extras, such as
                instructions and technical information (if applicable), will be
                present and correct.
